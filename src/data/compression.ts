It usually achieves similar compression ratios to Deflate, but is faster. At maximum compression, Zstd reaches compression ratios close to LZMA. Compared to libraries implementing Deflate, it achieves higher compression and decompression speeds.`,

The spiritual successor to bzip2 is bzip3, which was first released in 2022. It achieves even higher compression ratios than bzip2, but at the cost of lower speed.

The author of the Deflate method was the brilliant American programmer Phil Katz, who introduced it in 1992 in his PKZIP archiving program. Internally, it is a combination of the LZ77 dictionary compression method and Huffman coding. Before compression, the input data is divided into blocks of different sizes. Huffman tables are then compiled for each block separately. Dividing into blocks during compression is a complex optimization task that is solved by the Zopfli tool. Zopfli increases the compression ratio at the cost of an extremely slow compression speed.`,

LZ4 is comparable to the LZO (Lempel–Ziv–Oberhumer) method implemented by the lzop tool. The latter is focused on the speed of decompression, but it does not reach such speeds as LZ4. lzop was first released in 1997; does not have an official specification.`,

What do we see from the table? The bzip3 tool is very efficient. In most cases, however, zpaq surpassed it. Furthermore, we see that bzip2, brotli, zstd, lzma and xz are also decently effective. Then we have Deflate, where we see a significant jump in compression efficiency. So neither gzip nor Zopfli are very effective today. And then we have LZ4 and lzop, which you can see have a very low compression ratio. But that's the purpose. We want LZ4 to be very fast in compression and decompression at the cost of less efficient compression. Note which data compresses well for us. It is mainly an xml file, i.e. HTML files, on which a high compression ratio can be achieved. Other files are compressed a little less, but a typically achievable compression ratio is around 4.5.

            text: `In conclusion, we can say that zpaq and bzip3 are currently the most efficient compressors. Zopfli improves the compression ratio against gzip by 3–8% (still the same Deflate compression method). The tools lzop, lz4 and gzip are relatively fast but with a low compression ratio. LZMA, Zstd, Brotli methods achieve relatively high compression ratios, however bzip2, bzip3 and zpaq are even slightly more efficient. LZ4 has by far the fastest decompression (but low compression ratio), Zstd is also quite fast. LZMA, bzip2, bzip3 and zpaq are very slow when decompressing. Tools can be focused on compression speed (will bring a reduced compression ratio) – LZ4 wins here.`,
