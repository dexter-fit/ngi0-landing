However, many authors do need such advanced tools for their projects and Krita is still a way to save a lot of money. Software designed for tablets, such as Procreate, offers optimized UI, but Krita can also be used on mobile devices. Clip Studio Paint or Adobe Fresco offer easy workflows with advanced editing tools while Krita sometimes needs more experience to reproduce the same results, which, on the other hand, are more customizable.",
